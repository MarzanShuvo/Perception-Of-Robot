# Perception-Of-Robot

## Self Driving Car perception coursera python

This course has covered the followings:

* the pinhole camera model

* perform intrinsic and extrinsic camera calibration

* detection of object and estimation of depth using two camera

* describe and match image features

* design convolutional neural networks.


> :rocket: At the end of this course, I had to develop algorithms that identify bounding boxes for objects in the scene, and define the boundaries of the drivable surface.

## Robotic Perception matlab coursera

This course has covered the followings:

* Geometry of Image Formation

* Projective Transformations

* Pose Estimation

* Multi-View Geometry
